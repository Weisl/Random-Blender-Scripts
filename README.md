# Random Blender Scripts

This is a collection of random scripts I wrote over the years. They were made to solve a particular issue. They were not designed to be very reusable or user friendly. A lot of these scripts have been used to learn scripting and have been written for blender 2.7x. They have only been ported to work for newer versions of blender. 
I encountered similar issues over and over again and it's therefore very useful to keep this quick and dirty scripts around. 

### Addons
A collections of small addons, written for a specific purpose and not to be very generic.  

### Collections
All kind of scripts related to the creation and management of collections

### Display
Scripts to modify the viewport. E.g., quickly toggle the wireframe display for all selected objects. 

### Images
Scripts to manipulate image paths. 

### Materials
Scripts to create and manipulate materials

### Mesh
Scripts for editing and manipulating meshes. 

### Objects
Scripts for manipulating and organizing objects in the blender scene. 

### Render
Render related scripts.

### Selection
Scripts for selecting and deselecting objects. I use these kind of scripts to quickly debug certain properties of assets. E.g., selecting all objects that have been scaled. 

### Uv
Scripts to change and manipulate UV sets of multiple objects. I used it a lot in connection to lightmaps. E.g., switch the active UV sets for all selected objects to the lightmap or back to the main map, rename the standard Uv set to be named like in Maya for easier interoperability etc.
