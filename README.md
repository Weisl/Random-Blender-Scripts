# Random Blender Scripts

This is a collection of random scripts I wrote over the years. They were made to solve a particular issue. They were not designed to be very reusable or user-friendly. A lot of these scripts have been used to learn to script and have been written for blender 2.7x. They have only been ported to work for newer versions of blender. 
I encountered similar issues over and over again and it's therefore very useful to keep these quick and dirty scripts around. 

If you find the scripts useful consider paying for a coffee, here is a Paypal donation link.
